# WEB SOLUTION WITH WORDPRESS

This repository explains the steps involved in preparing storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implementing a basic web solution using WordPress.

You will gain practical experience that demonstrates three-tier architecture while also making sure that the Linux servers' storage disks are properly partitioned and maintained using tools like gdisk and LVM, respectively.

## The 3-Tier Setup
1. A Laptop or PC to serve as a client
2. An EC2 Linux Server as a web server (This is where you will install WordPress)
3. An EC2 Linux server as a database (DB) server

Generally, web, or mobile solutions are implemented based on what is called the Three-tier Architecture.
Three-tier Architecture is a client-server software architecture pattern that comprise of 3 separate layers.

1.	Presentation Layer (PL): This is the user interface such as the client server or browser on your laptop.
2.	Business Layer (BL): This is the backend program that implements business logic. Application or Webserver
3.	Data Access or Management Layer (DAL): This is the layer for computer data storage and data access. Database Server or File System Server such as FTP server, or NFS Server

# STEP 1 - PREPARE A WEB-SERVER
1.	Launch an EC2 instance that will serve as "Web Server". Create 3 volumes in the same AZ as your Web Server EC2, each of 10 GiB.

2.	Attach all three volumes one by one to your Web Server EC2 instance

3. Open up the Linux terminal to begin configuration Use `lsblk` command to inspect what block devices are attached to the server. Notice names of your newly created devices. All devices in Linux reside in /dev/ directory. Inspect it with `ls /dev/` and make sure you see all 3 newly created block devices there â€“ their names will likely be xvdf, xvdh, xvdg.

4.	Use df -h command to see all mounts and free space on your server

5.	Use fdisk utility to create a single partition on each of the 3 disks
`sudo fdisk /dev/xvdf`

6.	Use lsblk utility to view the newly configured partition on each of the 3 disks.

7. Install lvm2 package using `sudo yum install lvm2`. Run sudo lvmdiskscan command to check for available partitions.

*Note: yum is the package installer for RedHat/CentOS*
