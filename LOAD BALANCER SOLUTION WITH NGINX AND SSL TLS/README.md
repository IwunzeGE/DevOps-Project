# LOAD BALANCER SOLUTION WITH NGINX AND SSL/TLS

By now you have learned what Load Balancing is used for and have configured an LB solution using Apache, but a DevOps engineer must be a versatile professional and know different alternative solutions for the same problem. That is why, in this project we will configure an [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)Load Balancer solution.
It is also extremely important to ensure that connections to your Web solutions are secure and information is [encrypted in transit](https://security.berkeley.edu/data-encryption-transit-guideline) – we will also cover connection over secured HTTP (HTTPS protocol), its purpose and what is required to implement it.
When data is moving between a client (browser) and a Web Server over the Internet – it passes through multiple network devices and, if the data is not encrypted, it can be relatively easy intercepted by someone who has access to the intermediate equipment. This kind of information security threat is called [Man-In-The-Middle (MIMT) attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).
This threat is real – users that share sensitive information (bank details, social media access credentials, etc.) via non-secured channels, risk their data to be compromised and used by cybercriminals.

[SSL and its newer version, TSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer) – is a security technology that protects connection from MITM attacks by creating an encrypted session between browser and Web server. Here we will refer this family of cryptographic protocols as SSL/TLS – even though SSL was replaced by TLS, the term is still being widely used.

SSL/TLS uses [digital certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_certificate) to identify and validate a Website. A browser reads the certificate issued by a [Certificate Authority (CA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) to make sure that the website is registered in the CA so it can be trusted to establish a secured connection.
There are different types of SSL/TLS certificates – you can learn more about them [here](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/what-is-ssl). You can also watch a tutorial on how SSL works [here](https://youtu.be/T4Df5_cojAs) or an additional resource [here](https://youtu.be/SJJmoDZ3il8)
In this project you will register your website with LetsEnrcypt Certificate Authority, to automate certificate issuance you will use a shell client recommended by LetsEncrypt – cetrbot.

## Task
This project consists of two parts:
1.	Configure Nginx as a Load Balancer
2.	Register a new domain name and configure secured connection using SSL/TLS certificates
